MOBILE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT - IMAD5112

This is an Andriod application designed for users who love movies. This program gives users a platform to rate their favorite movies and view the most rated movies by users. 
You would be able to also view the average rated movies.

I have included the below:

1. Splash screen,
2. Buttons - "Add Movie" and "View Reviews"
3. Ability to display the average rating of movies currently.
4. View screen to provide additional information for each movie
5. I have also added error handling which include constructive feedback to the user.
6. Proper screen navigation buttons for smooth transitions between screens.

2. This is where a user is able to input a movie and rate by also leaving a comment:
